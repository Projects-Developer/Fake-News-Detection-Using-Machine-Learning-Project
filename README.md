## Abstract: 
Fake news detection is a critical task in today's digital age, where the spread of misinformation can have severe consequences. This project proposes a machine learning-based approach to detect fake news articles. The approach leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques and deep learning algorithms to analyze the content and structure of news articles. The proposed model is trained on a labeled dataset and evaluated using metrics such as accuracy, precision, and recall. The results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed approach in detecting fake news articles, with potential applications in social media platforms, news aggregator websites, and fact-checking websites.
